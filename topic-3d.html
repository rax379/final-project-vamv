				Your mouth and teeth form your smile, which is often the first thing people notice when they look at you. Bad breath, halitosis, gum disease, plaque and cavities can be a major problem, especially when you're about to snuggle with your sweetie or whisper a joke to your friend. The good news is that these bad signs can often be prevented with some simple steps.
				<ul>
					<li>Dentists say that the minimum time you should spend brushing your teeth is 2 minutes twice a day. </li>
					<li>Brushing is important but it won't remove the plaque and particles of food between your teeth, under the gumline, or under braces. You'll need to floss these spaces at least once a day.</li>
					<li>While mouthwash in and of itself is no substitute for brushing your teeth, it plays an important complementary role in oral health. Use mouthwash every time you brush your teeth.</li>
					<li>Toothbrushes should be changed 3 to 4 times a year. </li>
					<li>Teenagers with braces may need to use special toothbrushes and other oral hygiene tools to brush their teeth. Talk to your dentist or orthodontist.</li>

					Dentists say that the most important part of tooth care happens at home. Brushing and flossing properly, along with regular dental checkups, can help prevent tooth decay and gum disease. "Taking care of your teeth and gums isn't just about preventing cavities or bad breath," the American Dental Association warns. "The mouth is a gateway into your body's overall health."Clean teeth are happy teeth.
