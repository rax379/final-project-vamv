				There are many negative consequences when you are not getting enough sleep.  Your ability to listen and concentrate might be affected.  You can have aggressive or inappropriate behavior. Lack of sleep might also cause you to make poor food choices that might lead to weight gain and it might affect your skin by causing acne.<br>
				Here is a list of  things that you can do to help you establish a good sleeping routine:
				<ul>
					<li>Try going to bed at the same time every day, and waking up at the same time every day (yes, that includes the weekend).  </li>
					<li>Avoid the television and computer at least an hour before bedtime. </li>
					<li>Create a routine before bedtime that will signal to your body that it is time for bed.</li>
					<li>Make your room a special place for sleeping by keeping it cool, quiet and dark.</li>
				</ul>

					Sleep is food for the brain.  It is vital to your well-being and it is as important as the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat.  During sleep, important body functions and brain activity occur.  It is important that you sleep the recommended 8-10 hours so that you can be alert and ready to tackle the day.  Not getting enough sleep can cause more serious problems than just being sleepy.  You will physically look bad, feel moody, and perform poorly in school and in sports.
