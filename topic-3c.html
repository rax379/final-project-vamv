						<h1>Take Care of Your Hair</h1>
					</header>
				
				<p>
				How you take care of your hair depends on the type of hair you have, your lifestyle, and how you style your hair.

Your hair type: Teens with dry, curly hair have different hair care needs than teens with straight, fine hair. But all hair needs to be treated gently, especially when it's wet. 

Your hairstyle: Heat styling products like curling and straightening irons can dry out even oily hair if they're used too much. Follow the instructions carefully, and don't use them on wet hair or high settings, and give your hair a vacation from styling once in awhile

Do you play sports or spend a lot of time outside? These kinds of things can affect your hair. For example, if you're an athlete with oily hair, you may want to wash your hair after working up a sweat during practice and games.

					Learning how to care for your hair is a big step in tackling hygiene and in feeling good about yourself. 
					Teens can be very insecure about their physical appearance and self-conscious about their hair, skin 
					and clothes. If you are not sure where to begin when it comes to taking care of your hair, read the  
					instructions provided to help you get started.
