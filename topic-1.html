					Sleep is food for the brain.  It is vital to your well-being and it is as important as the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat.  During sleep, important body functions and brain activity occur.  It is important that you sleep the recommended 8-10 hours so that you can be alert and ready to tackle the day.  Not getting enough sleep can cause more serious problems than just being sleepy.  You will physically look bad, feel moody, and perform poorly in school and in sports.				
					It can be fun and yummy to eat fun foods such as pizza, Flaming Hot Cheetos, Takis, and your favorite candy bar, but have you ever thought about the effects of eating too much of this.  As a teen, it is important to keep a healthy diet in mind to keep growing into a healthy person in the long run.  Remember the results of bad diet choices, can result into bad consequences; instead why not make good healthy choices to live an energetic and longer life.
