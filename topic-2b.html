				Here are some examples of non-competitive sports that you can try by yourself or with friends.
				<ul>
					<li>Hiking: Take a short hike or a long one.  You will feel great breathing in the fresh air and hiking with friends will help create tight friendship bonds.</li>
					<li>Canoeing: This might look like and easy activity, but canoeing requires you to have balance and coordination.  It will also provide a great workout for your arms.</li>
					<li>Kayaking:  Like canoeing, kayaking requires you have coordination and it is a great way to get a good arm workout.</li>
					<li>Archery:  This activity requires that you focus and concentrate.  Hitting that bulls-eye will give you a great sense of accomplishment.</li>
					<li>Surfing:  This fun activity will have you riding waves and enjoying the great outdoors.</li>
					<li>Skateboarding:  This is an activity that can be done individually or with friends. </li>
				</ul>

					Doing sports is a great way for you and your friends to stay active.  As mentioned before, joining a sports team at school or in a city league are great ways to incorporate sports into your life.  However, if you are not into competitive sports, there are many non-competitive options.  Learning the new skills required to learn a new sport will help you in your growth and will provide fun challenges to you.  You might also find that doing these activities might help express your inner self.  Give it a try and see which one appeals more to you.  Remember, this is about staying active.
