				 There are many health problems linked to excessive weight. About 1 in 3 teens in the United States are considered overweight. 
				 Doctors are diagnosing more children and young adults like you with illnesses that were usually found in adults. Staying  
				 active, exercising, and eating healthy might seem hard, especially when all around you, there are advertisements for fast foods.
				 Try to get a support group that values the choices you are making and that will support you in the changes you are trying to make.
				 Here is a list of some of the medical conditions that overweight young adults might develop by having a sedentary 
				 lifestyle that includes poor health food choices. <br>
				<ul>
					<li>heart problems</li>
					<li>diabetes: too much sugar in your body</li>
					<li>asthma: problems breathing</li>
					<li>cancer</li>
					<li>low self-esteem</li>
					<li>depression</li>
				</ul>

					Talking about weight can sometimes be uncomfortable. However, being overweight can be a scary thing due to the many 
					illnesses that are associated with excess weight. At your age, there are many changes happening to your body and 
					your weight is going to be affected.  You need to make healthy choices about your food and fitness levels to 
					avoid having problems with your health. Instead of looking at scales and numbers and charts that tell you how 
					much you should weigh, you need to see what you are doing to help maintain a good weight.
