				It is very important for young teens to dress appropriately at school or any social function.  Taking pride on what you wear is key to your self-esteem. <br>
				The list below describes a school’s dress code:
				<ul>
					<li>Shorts and skorts may be worn at the elementary school level. In grades three through five, they should be no more than four inches above the top of the kneecap. Shorts and skorts are prohibited in grades six through twelve. </li>
					<li>In grades three through twelve, skirts, dresses, and culottes must be no more than four inches above the top of the kneecap. There should not be a cut or slit in the clothing that extends beyond the four inch limit. These requirements also apply to school uniforms.</li>
					<li> Appropriate footwear must be worn; footwear which has toes reinforced with steel, hard plastics or similar materials is specifically prohibited.</li>
				</ul>

					Age-appropriate clothing for tweens is anything you can comfortably move in. You need to be able to run, jump, and cart-wheel freely without worrying about being exposed. The same goes with shoes; they should be comfortable and not restrict movement in anyway. “Inappropriate” clothing limits girls’ and boys’ mobility or feels constricting. Uncomfortable clothing sends the message it’s more important that girls and boys look good for other people, rather than feel good and have fun.
