				<p>
				Bad habits are hard to break, but if you're consistent and motivated, you can break them (and even avoid them from the start).  Below are some bad habits you want to avoid as a young teen.
				<ul>
					<li>Spending too much time watching TV- The more TV you watch, the less physical activity you're getting, increasing your odds of being overweight and developing type 2 diabetes.</li>
					<li> Avoid over-criticizing your personal looks - This sends the message that self-esteem should be based on how your clothes fit or how much you weigh. This can lead to unhealthy habits like yo-yo dieting or risk of dangerous eating disorders.</li>
				    <li>Do not use food to feel better when you're sad or disappointed - Talking to friends, family or the school counselor is a healthier alternative.
 					<li>Nail Biting - Of course, nail biting is not a dangerous habit, but it is not appealing either. No one wants to be 30-years-old and still gnawing away at his or her fingernails.</li>
				 </ul>

						"Old habits die hard" is a popular adage that holds weight. Everyone has their weaknesses, but some habits are extremely common. And there are explanations behind why these habits are so hard to break. They may be impulsive behaviors, feel-good tendencies, stress reducers or even based in biology. Here are four common, unfortunate habits that are difficult to break with willpower alone.
