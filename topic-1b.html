				Reading and understanding food labels will help you keep track of good nutrition in your life.  It is important to know what vitamins and nutrients are in foods.  The best way is by reading food labels.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) decide what goes on the food labels.  Here is a guide to reading a food label:
			<ul>
				<li> First, read the serving size.  The information for food label starts here with the serving size.  It is important to read this so you don’t overeat your favorite food. </li>
				<li> Next, read calories.  This will tell you how many calories are in one serving size and how many calories are in fat.  
				<li> Then, read the percentage daily value.  According to the USDA and FDA, these are an “average person’s” calorie intake based on a 2,000 calorie diet.  </li>
				<li> Next, read the fat.  Remember not all fats are bad such as unsaturated fats because they don’t affect our cholesterol.  However, you must be cautious of bad fats such as Saturated fats and trans fats which do affect your cholesterol and give you a high risk of heart disease. </li>
				<li> Then, read the cholesterol.  Like fats, there are good cholesterol and bad cholesterol.  Therefore, it is important to distinguish both to avoid health complications in the future.</li>
				<li> Next, read the Sodium.  A small amount of sodium is good, but too much sodium can lead to bloating and high blood pressure.  </li>
				<li> Then, read carbohydrates.  There are good carbohydrates that are in fruits, vegetables, and whole-grains.   However, you must cautious in foods that are listed low fat because they can still contain high amounts of carbohydrates.  Even sugar is listed under carbohydrates, which you must be careful when choosing foods with high sugar but with no nutritional value in it. </li>
				<li> Next, read the fiber.  Fiber help you reduce bad cholesterol and have a healthy digestive system. </li>
				<li> Then, read the protein.  Protein will help with your energy levels. </li>
				<li> Finally, read the vitamins and minerals.  Try to pick foods with high levels of vitamins of A and C.  Also, with iron and calcium. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>These food labels were created to guide in creating and balancing a healthy lifestyle and making the right choices.
