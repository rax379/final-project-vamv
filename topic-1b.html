				Reading and understanding food labels will help you keep track of good nutrition in your life.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) decide what goes on the food labels.  Here is a guide to reading a food label:
				<ul>
					<li> First it is important to read the serving size so you won’t overeat. </li>
					<li> Next, read calories so you know how many are in one serving size and are in fat.  
					<li> Then, read the percentage daily value to follow the average person calorie diet according to the USDA and FDA regulations. </li>
					<li> Next, read the fat because not all fats are bad such as unsaturated fats. However, you must be cautious of bad fats such as saturated fats and trans fats which do affect your cholesterol and give you a high risk of heart disease. </li>
					<li>  Then, read the cholesterol to distinguish good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. </li>
					<li> Next, read the sodium because too much of it can lead to bloating and high blood pressure.  </li>
					<li> Then, read carbohydrates because there are good carbohydrates, but sometimes sugar can be listed under carbohydrates. This foods can contain no nutritional value.</li>
					<li> Next, read the fiber so it can help you reduce bad cholesterol and have a healthy digestive system. </li>
					<li> Then, read the protein so it will help you with your energy levels. </li>
					<li> Finally, read the vitamins and minerals especially high levels of vitamins of A and C.  Also, with iron and calcium. </li>
				</ul>
			<p>These food labels were created to guide in creating and balancing a healthy lifestyle and making the right choices.
